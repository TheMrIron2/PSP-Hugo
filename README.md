# PSP-Hugo

Hugo (v1.3.1) is a TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine emulator for the PSP. It runs most games at full speed at 266MHz, sometimes 222MHz and sometimes requiring 300MHz (especially for CD-ROM games). It boasts high compatibility, good performance and good accuracy.

## Modern Branch

This branch of PSP-Hugo will document my attempt to get this compiling under a recent PSP SDK. I'll also see if I can make it compliant with C11 or C18 standards, if time and interest allows.

## Credits

Special thanks to Nicholas C. for "his support and kindness" (as per README.txt).

I do not own any rights to this emulator. However, finding the source to this emulator nowadays isn't immediately clear as it is not on GitHub at all as far as I can tell, so I have taken the liberty of uploading the source to GitHub.
This almost definitely will *not* build on recent PSP SDKs, and that is something I might fix in a separate branch at another point, but for the sake of preservation this is the original code.
